*Task-Tails program is designed for individuals 
who struggle with excessive procrastination during studying.

*Our program follows the Reward and Punishment method for 
effective usage. Focus on studying during study sessions 
and take breaks when it's time to rest. 
The program temporarily blocks selected websites while the user is studying.

*Before using the program, you need to specify 
the websites you want to block under the "sites to be blocked" section.

*To begin a study session, please click on the timer 
located in the top right corner. It will track the study 
and break times, and an alarm will notify you when each session is completed.
Additionally, if you have urgent matters to attend to, 
you can click the "pause button" to temporarily stop the timer.
